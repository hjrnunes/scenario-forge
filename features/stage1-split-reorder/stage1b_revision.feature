# stage1b-revision
Feature: Stage 1b Capability Profile Revision
  The Stage 1b (capability profile inference) prompt is revised:
    - The full KC taxonomy is included as a reference table.
    - Loss-analysis context is removed (1b has zero dependency on 1a).
    - Schneider zones are removed as LLM output (computed from KC codes).
    - The rigid entry-point checklist is replaced by KC-driven reasoning.
    - STPA-Sec terminology is dropped.
  The Stage1Profile model drops `has_persistent_memory`, `multi_agent`,
  and `hitl` as direct LLM-inferred fields — they are computed from
  `kc_subcodes` on the CapabilityProfile.

  Background:
    Given a use-case file and a risk-extraction file are available
    And an LLM endpoint is configured

  # stage1b-revision-no-loss-context
  Scenario: Capability profile is produced without loss-analysis dependency
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And the output directory contains `capability-profile.yaml`
    And the output directory contains `loss-analysis.yaml`

  # stage1b-revision-kc-subcodes-present
  Scenario: Capability profile contains KC sub-codes
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has a non-empty `kc_subcodes` list
    And every value in `kc_subcodes` is a valid KC sub-code

  # stage1b-revision-zones-computed
  Scenario: Zones are computed from KC sub-codes, not LLM-inferred
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has a `zones_active` list containing `input` and `reasoning`

  # stage1b-revision-computed-bool-flags
  Scenario: Boolean flags are computed from KC sub-codes, not LLM fields
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has `has_persistent_memory` consistent with `kc_subcodes`
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has `multi_agent` consistent with `kc_subcodes`
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has `hitl` consistent with `kc_subcodes`

  # stage1b-revision-stage1-profile-no-bool-fields
  Scenario: Stage1Profile model does not declare boolean capability fields
    Then the `Stage1Profile` model does not declare `has_persistent_memory`
    And the `Stage1Profile` model does not declare `multi_agent`
    And the `Stage1Profile` model does not declare `hitl`

  # stage1b-revision-entry-points-present
  Scenario: Capability profile contains entry points
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And `capability-profile.yaml` has a non-empty `entry_points` list
    And every entry point has a `name` and a `direction`

  # stage1b-revision-tool-inventory
  Scenario: Capability profile contains tool inventory when tool_execution zone is active
    When I run `scenario-forge stpa-run --use-case <use_case> --risk-extraction <risk_file> --output-dir <dir>`
    Then the command exits with code 0
    And if `capability-profile.yaml` has `tool_execution` in `zones_active` then `tool_inventory` is non-empty

  # stage1b-revision-kc-taxonomy-in-prompt
  Scenario: The stage1b system prompt includes the KC taxonomy
    Then the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` contains the text `KC1 — Language Models`
    And the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` contains the text `KC6 — Operational Environment`
    And the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` contains the text `KCX — Extended Capabilities`

  # stage1b-revision-no-loss-context-in-prompt
  Scenario: The stage1b user prompt does not include loss-analysis context
    Then the prompt template `stage1b_user.j2` does not contain `loss_analysis`
    And the prompt template `stage1b_user.j2` does not contain `all_losses`
    And the prompt template `stage1b_user.j2` does not contain `security_constraints`

  # stage1b-revision-no-stpa-terminology
  Scenario: The stage1b system prompt does not mention STPA-Sec
    Then the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` does not contain `STPA`

  # stage1b-revision-no-zones-output-in-prompt
  Scenario: The stage1b system prompt does not request zones_active as output
    Then the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` does not contain `zones_active`

  # stage1b-revision-no-entry-point-checklist
  Scenario: The stage1b system prompt does not contain the five-category checklist
    Then the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` does not contain `User input surfaces`
    And the prompt template `stage1b_system.j2` does not contain `Entry point category checklist`
