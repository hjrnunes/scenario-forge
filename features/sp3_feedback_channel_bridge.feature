Feature: SP3 feedback-channel bridge
  An FB identifier denotes a logical information dependency that updates a
  process-model belief. Stage 3, Stage 5, and Stage 6 narrative prompts direct
  the model to realize that dependency through a declared AI surface instead
  of inferring an attacker-accessible network or session mechanism.

  Background:
    Given the SP3 prompt templates are available

  # SP3-FCB-01
  Scenario Outline: SP3-FCB-01 generation prompts name each AI surface
    When the <stage> system prompt is rendered
    Then the prompt defines an FB identifier as a logical information dependency that updates a process-model belief
    And the prompt states that an FB identifier is not evidence of an attacker-accessible transport
    And the prompt includes the declared AI surface <surface>

    Examples:
      | stage             | surface                |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | prompt/context input   |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | retrieved content     |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | tool result            |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | memory state           |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | agent message          |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | model output           |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | prompt/context input   |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | retrieved content     |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | tool result            |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | memory state           |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | agent message          |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | model output           |
      | Stage 6 narrative | prompt/context input   |
      | Stage 6 narrative | retrieved content     |
      | Stage 6 narrative | tool result            |
      | Stage 6 narrative | memory state           |
      | Stage 6 narrative | agent message          |
      | Stage 6 narrative | model output           |

  Scenario Outline: SP3-FCB-01 prompts reject each inferred mechanism
    When the <stage> system prompt is rendered
    Then the prompt forbids inventing mechanism <mechanism> without explicit attacker-accessible architecture evidence

    Examples:
      | stage             | mechanism                         |

      | Stage 3 ICA       | traffic blocking                  |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | network-signal spoofing           |

      | Stage 3 ICA       | account takeover                  |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | session hijacking or fixation     |
      | Stage 3 ICA       | generic flooding or denial of service |
      | Stage 5 BDI       | packet interception               |

  # SP3-FCB-02
  Scenario: SP3-FCB-02 logical feedback is realized through the declared AI surface
    Given an architecture where FB-1-1 updates PM-1-1 from retrieved content
    And the architecture declares no attacker-accessible transport or session surface
    And a deterministic instruction-following LLM
    When SP3 generates the attack narrative
    Then the narrative realizes the FB-1-1 manipulation by poisoning retrieved content
    And the narrative does not invent an infrastructure or session mechanism

  # SP3-FCB-03
  Scenario: SP3-FCB-03 explicit accessible transport permits an evidenced transport mechanism
    Given an architecture where FB-1-1 updates PM-1-1 through transport webhook-1
    And transport webhook-1 is explicitly declared attacker-accessible
    And a deterministic instruction-following LLM
    When SP3 generates the attack narrative through transport interception
    Then the narrative identifies webhook-1 as the architecture evidence for interception
