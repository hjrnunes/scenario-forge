Feature: SP3 — Run orchestration
  The SP3 run orchestrates Stage 5 (BDI generation), Stage 6 (narrative,
  attack tree, Gherkin), and Stage 7 (validators, eval metrics, coverage
  gaps) in sequence. Stage 5 produces ScenarioSpec instances. Stage 6
  concretizes each into a ScenarioEnvelope. Stage 7 validates and scores.
  All LLM calls are logged to calls.jsonl and a run manifest is written.
