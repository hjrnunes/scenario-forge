Feature: SP3 Stage 5 — Dual-BDI scenario specification
  Stage 5 produces a ScenarioSpec per structural threat. The defender BDI is
  deterministically pre-populated from the control structure (PM→beliefs,
  RESP→desires, CA→intentions). One LLM call per scenario fills defender
  vulnerability annotations and generates the attacker BDI. The ScenarioSpec
  is assembled deterministically and validated against the control structure.

  Background:
    Given the SP3 BDI generation module is importable
    And a control structure with responsibility RESP-1 having process model parts PM-1-1 and PM-1-2, control actions CA-1-1 and CA-1-2, and feedback channels FB-1-1
    And an enriched threat set with a structural threat for ICA slot RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED

  # SP3-BDI-01
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-01 defender BDI beliefs are derived from process model parts
    Given a control structure where RESP-1 has process model parts PM-1-1 and PM-1-2
    When the defender BDI is pre-populated for RESP-1
    Then the defender BDI has 2 beliefs
    And belief 1 references pm_id PM-1-1
    And belief 2 references pm_id PM-1-2
    And each belief content matches the process model part description

  # SP3-BDI-02
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-02 defender BDI desires are derived from the responsibility
    Given a control structure where RESP-1 has description "Authorize payment operations"
    When the defender BDI is pre-populated for RESP-1
    Then the defender BDI has at least 1 desire
    And each desire references resp_id RESP-1
    And each desire content matches the responsibility description

  # SP3-BDI-03
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-03 defender BDI intentions are derived from control actions
    Given a control structure where RESP-1 has control actions CA-1-1 and CA-1-2
    When the defender BDI is pre-populated for RESP-1
    Then the defender BDI has 2 intentions
    And intention 1 references ca_id CA-1-1
    And intention 2 references ca_id CA-1-2
    And each intention content matches the control action description

  # SP3-BDI-04
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-04 defender belief vulnerability fields are empty before the LLM call
    When the defender BDI is pre-populated for RESP-1
    Then every belief has an empty vulnerability field

  # SP3-BDI-05
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-05 one LLM call per scenario fills vulnerability annotations and attacker BDI
    Given an LLM that returns defender vulnerabilities for each PM and a valid attacker BDI
    When the BDI generation LLM call is executed for the scenario
    Then exactly 1 LLM call is made
    And the call is labeled with stage stage_5
    And the call step is bdi_generation

  # SP3-BDI-06
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-06 LLM fills non-empty vulnerability annotations on each defender belief
    Given an LLM that returns vulnerability annotations for PM-1-1 and PM-1-2
    When the BDI generation LLM call is executed and vulnerabilities are merged
    Then every defender belief has a non-empty vulnerability annotation

  # SP3-BDI-07
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-07 LLM generates attacker BDI with beliefs, desires, and intentions
    Given an LLM that returns an attacker BDI with 3 beliefs, 2 desires, and 3 intentions
    When the BDI generation LLM call is executed
    Then the attacker BDI has 3 beliefs
    And the attacker BDI has 2 desires
    And the attacker BDI has 3 intentions

  # SP3-BDI-08
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-08 attacker BDI beliefs reference defender process model weaknesses
    Given an LLM that returns an attacker BDI whose beliefs reference PM-1-1
    When the BDI generation LLM call is executed
    Then at least one attacker belief references PM-1-1

  # SP3-BDI-09
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-09 ScenarioSpec is assembled with threat source and catalog context
    Given a structural threat with ica_slot_id RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED and provenance structural
    And the threat has catalog mappings for OWASP_AGENTIC T1
    When the ScenarioSpec is assembled
    Then the scenario spec has threat_source ica_slot_id RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED
    And the scenario spec has threat_source provenance structural
    And the scenario spec has target_controller RESP-1
    And the scenario spec has target_control_action CA-1-1
    And the scenario spec has ica_type NOT_PROVIDED
    And the scenario spec has catalog context with 1 mapping

  # SP3-BDI-10
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-10 scenario ID follows SCN-NNN format
    When the ScenarioSpec is assembled for the first scenario
    Then the scenario_id matches the pattern SCN-NNN

  # SP3-BDI-11
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-11 post-call validation checks BDI grounding against control structure
    Given a defender BDI with all beliefs, desires, and intentions referencing valid control structure IDs
    When the scenario spec is validated against the control structure
    Then validation succeeds

  # SP3-BDI-12
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-12 post-call validation fails on non-existent PM reference
    Given a defender BDI with a belief referencing PM-99-1
    When the scenario spec is validated against the control structure
    Then validation fails with error containing pm_id

  # SP3-BDI-13
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-13 post-call validation fails on non-existent CA reference
    Given a defender BDI with an intention referencing CA-99-1
    When the scenario spec is validated against the control structure

  # SP3-BDI-14

    Given a control structure with RESP-1 and RESP-2 where CA-2-1 belongs to RESP-2
    And a scenario spec with target_controller RESP-1 and target_control_action CA-2-1
    When the scenario spec is validated against the control structure
    Then validation fails with error containing target_control_action

  # SP3-BDI-15

    Then validation fails with error containing vulnerability

  # SP3-BDI-16
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-16 LLM-altered defender BDI IDs are replaced with deterministic values
    Given an LLM that returns defender vulnerabilities with altered pm_id values
    When the BDI generation result is processed
    Then the defender BDI uses the original deterministic pm_id values
    And the vulnerability annotations are extracted by matching to the original pm_id values

  # SP3-BDI-17

    And the user prompt contains the ICA text
    And the user prompt contains the hazardous context
    And the user prompt contains the loss scenario

  # SP3-BDI-18
  Scenario: SP3-BDI-18 system prompt defines the dual-BDI interaction model
    When the BDI generation LLM call is executed
    Then the system prompt contains instructions for defender vulnerability annotation
