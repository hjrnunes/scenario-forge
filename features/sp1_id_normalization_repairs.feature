Feature: SP1 ID normalization repairs
  SP1 repairs recoverable LLM control-structure fields before schema
  validation. An ElementRef whose type repeats its RESP-* or CP-* ID receives
  the corresponding reference type, and a blank element description receives
  a human-readable description from its normalized context. Valid supplied
  values remain unchanged, while values that cannot be inferred still fail
  validation.

  Background:
    Given a tolerantly decoded SP1 control-structure payload
    And every field not varied by the scenario is valid

  # SP1-ID-NORMALIZATION-REPAIRS-01 infers malformed ElementRef types and preserves valid types
  Scenario Outline: SP1-ID-NORMALIZATION-REPAIRS-01 infers malformed ElementRef types and preserves valid types
    Given the element at <referenced_position> has source ID <source_id>
    And <reference_owner> has <reference_field> type <supplied_type> and ID <source_id>
    And <reference_owner> <reference_field> was supplied with type <expected_input>
    When the payload is normalized
    Then <reference_owner> <reference_field> has type <reference_type>
    And <reference_owner> <reference_field> has ID <canonical_id>
    And source ID <expected_source> maps to <canonical_id>
    And the normalized payload validates as a ControlStructure

    Examples:
      | referenced_position  | source_id | expected_source | reference_owner                        | reference_field | supplied_type      | expected_input     | reference_type     | canonical_id |
