Feature: Envelope consumer_hints filtering metadata (8b06)
  The ScenarioEnvelope gains an optional consumer_hints block with
  deterministic, rule-based fields that let adapters self-select
  scenarios without LLM inference. Fields are computed in a
  post-generation enrichment pass from the capability profile, attack
  tree, and narrative — no LLM calls.

  Background:
    Given the STPA boundary schema module is importable
    And a valid scenario spec SCN-001 with target_controller RESP-1 and target_control_action CA-1-1
    And a capability profile with active_zones ["input", "reasoning", "tool_execution"]
    And the capability profile has multi_agent False
    And the capability profile has has_persistent_memory False
    And an attack tree with root "Exploit input validation" and leaves mentioning tool execution
    And a narrative describing a single-turn attack
