Feature: SP1 Stage 1a — Loss Analysis derivation
  Stage 1a derives losses, hazards, and security constraints from use-case
  text and risk cards via a single LLM call. Output is a valid LossAnalysis
  with dual-source provenance: risk-card-derived losses (provenance=risk_card,
  non-empty source_risk_cards) and use-case-derived losses (provenance=use_case,
  empty source_risk_cards). Post-call validation enforces the same rules as
  the foundation LossAnalysis schema.

  Background:
    Given the STPA system model module is importable
    And a use-case description and risk cards are available as input

  # SP1-LA-01
  Scenario: SP1-LA-01 valid LLM response produces a valid LossAnalysis
    Given an LLM that returns a valid loss analysis JSON with risk-card losses and use-case losses
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then a LossAnalysis model is produced
    And the loss analysis passes foundation validation

  # SP1-LA-02
  Scenario: SP1-LA-02 risk-card-derived losses have correct provenance
    Given an LLM that returns losses L-1 and L-2 with provenance risk_card and source_risk_cards atlas-001 and atlas-002
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then the risk_card_losses contain L-1 and L-2 with provenance risk_card
    And each risk_card_loss has non-empty source_risk_cards

  # SP1-LA-03
  Scenario: SP1-LA-03 use-case-derived losses have correct provenance
    Given an LLM that returns loss L-3 with provenance use_case and empty source_risk_cards
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then the use_case_losses contain L-3 with provenance use_case
    And each use_case_loss has empty source_risk_cards

  # SP1-LA-04
  Scenario Outline: SP1-LA-04 LLM response with invalid cross-reference fails post-call validation
    Given an LLM that returns a loss analysis where <entity> references non-existent <ref_target>
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then post-call validation fails with error containing <error_fragment>

    Examples:
      | entity           | ref_target | error_fragment     |
      | hazard           | loss L-99  | related_losses     |
      | constraint       | hazard H-99| related_hazards    |

  # SP1-LA-05
  Scenario: SP1-LA-05 LLM response with risk-card loss missing source_risk_cards fails
    Given an LLM that returns a risk-card loss L-1 with empty source_risk_cards
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then post-call validation fails with error containing source_risk_cards

  # SP1-LA-06
  Scenario: SP1-LA-06 LLM response with use-case loss having source_risk_cards fails
    Given an LLM that returns a use-case loss L-3 with source_risk_cards atlas-001
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then post-call validation fails with error containing source_risk_cards

  # SP1-LA-07
  Scenario: SP1-LA-07 LLM response with duplicate loss IDs fails
    Given an LLM that returns a loss analysis with duplicate loss_id L-1
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then post-call validation fails with error containing duplicate

  # SP1-LA-08
  Scenario: SP1-LA-08 LLM call is logged with stage stage_1a
    Given an LLM that returns a valid loss analysis JSON
    And a run directory for call logging
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then a call log entry is appended with stage stage_1a
    And the call log entry step is loss_analysis

  # SP1-LA-09
  Scenario: SP1-LA-09 loss analysis is written to loss-analysis.yaml
    Given an LLM that returns a valid loss analysis JSON
    And a run directory for output
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then a file loss-analysis.yaml exists in the run directory
    And the file contains a valid LossAnalysis model when read back

  # SP1-LA-10
  Scenario: SP1-LA-10 both risk-card and use-case losses can coexist
    Given an LLM that returns risk-card losses L-1 and L-2 and use-case losses L-3 and L-4
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then the risk_card_losses contain L-1 and L-2
    And the use_case_losses contain L-3 and L-4
    And the loss analysis passes foundation validation

  # SP1-LA-11
  Scenario: SP1-LA-11 every hazard links to at least one loss
    Given an LLM that returns a loss analysis with hazard H-1 referencing L-1 and hazard H-2 referencing L-2
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then the loss analysis passes foundation validation

  # SP1-LA-12
  Scenario: SP1-LA-12 every security constraint links to at least one hazard
    Given an LLM that returns a loss analysis with constraint SC-1 referencing H-1 and constraint SC-2 referencing H-2
    When Stage 1a loss analysis is run
    Then the loss analysis passes foundation validation
