Feature: SP1 KC sub-code display in serialized YAML
  The capability-profile.yaml artifact should include a human-readable
  companion field kc_subcodes_display that maps each KC sub-code to its
  description. The original kc_subcodes list[str] field is unchanged.
  Downstream consumers continue reading kc_subcodes as list[str]; the
  display field is purely additive for human readability. The injection
  happens after model_dump() but before YAML serialization in both the
  STPA pipeline (write_yaml) and the existing pipeline (io.py) paths.

  Background:
    Given the capability profile module is importable
    And a valid CapabilityProfile with kc_subcodes KC1.1, KCX-PRIV, and KC5.1
    And the capability profile is serialized to capability-profile.yaml via the STPA write_yaml path

  # KCDisp-01
  Scenario: KCDisp-01 capability-profile.yaml contains kc_subcodes_display field
    Then the YAML file contains a kc_subcodes_display field
    And kc_subcodes_display is a dict

  # KCDisp-02
  Scenario: KCDisp-02 OWASP KC codes map to their descriptions from KC_SUBCODE_NAMES
    Then kc_subcodes_display contains key KC1.1 mapped to Large Language Model (LLM)
    And kc_subcodes_display contains key KC5.1 mapped to Flexible libraries / SDK

  # KCDisp-03
  Scenario: KCDisp-03 KCX extension codes map to their descriptions from KCX_SUBCODES
    Then kc_subcodes_display contains key KCX-PRIV mapped to a description containing privilege

  # KCDisp-04
  Scenario: KCDisp-04 unknown codes fall back to the code string itself
    Given a valid CapabilityProfile with kc_subcodes KC1.1 and UNKNOWN-CODE
    When the capability profile is serialized to capability-profile.yaml via the STPA write_yaml path
    Then kc_subcodes_display contains key UNKNOWN-CODE mapped to UNKNOWN-CODE

  # KCDisp-05
  Scenario: KCDisp-05 kc_subcodes list[str] field is unchanged after serialization
    Then the YAML file contains a kc_subcodes field
    And kc_subcodes is a list containing KC1.1, KCX-PRIV, and KC5.1

  # KCDisp-06
  Scenario: KCDisp-06 reloading the YAML as CapabilityProfile ignores the extra display field
    When the YAML file is loaded as a CapabilityProfile
    Then the loaded model has kc_subcodes KC1.1, KCX-PRIV, and KC5.1
    And no validation error is raised

  # KCDisp-07
  Scenario: KCDisp-07 existing pipeline io.py serialization path also injects kc_subcodes_display
    Given the capability profile is serialized to capability-profile.yaml via the existing pipeline io.py path
    Then the YAML file contains a kc_subcodes_display field
    And kc_subcodes_display contains key KC1.1 mapped to Large Language Model (LLM)

  # KCDisp-08
  Scenario: KCDisp-08 a shared helper is used by both serialization paths
    Given the STPA write_yaml path and the existing pipeline io.py path
    Then both paths use the same helper function to build kc_subcodes_display
