Feature: SP3 Stage 7 — Validators
  Stage 7 runs two layers of validation. Stage-local validators check BDI
  grounding, vulnerability completeness, tree branch coverage, and Gherkin
  structure at each stage boundary. End-to-end traceability validation checks
  the full provenance chain: provenance root → loss → hazard → constraint →
  responsibility → CA → ICA → scenario. Foreign-key constraints are enforced
  at every link.

  Background:
    Given the SP3 validators module is importable
    And a control structure with responsibility RESP-1, PM-1-1, CA-1-1, and FB-1-1
    And a loss analysis with loss L-1, hazard H-1, and security constraint SC-1
    And an enriched threat set with a structural threat for ICA slot RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED

  # SP3-VAL-08
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-08 tree branch coverage validator passes with 2 or more categories
    Given a scenario with an attack tree using controller_side and path_side categories
    When tree branch coverage validation is performed
    Then validation succeeds

  # SP3-VAL-09
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-09 Gherkin structure validator fails on missing But line
    Given a scenario with Gherkin text that has no But line
    When Gherkin structure validation is performed
    Then validation fails with error containing but

  # SP3-VAL-10
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-10 Gherkin structure validator fails on missing should keyword
    Given a scenario with Gherkin text that has no should keyword in a Then line
    When Gherkin structure validation is performed
    Then validation fails with error containing should

  # SP3-VAL-11
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-11 Gherkin structure validator passes on valid should/but with PM reference
    Given a scenario with Gherkin text containing Then-should, But, and Given referencing PM-1-1
    When Gherkin structure validation is performed
    Then validation succeeds

  # SP3-VAL-12
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-12 traceability validation passes on complete unbroken chain
    Given a scenario tracing from loss L-1 through hazard H-1, constraint SC-1, responsibility RESP-1, CA-1-1, ICA RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED:1
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then no traceability errors are returned

  # SP3-VAL-13
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-13 traceability validation fails on broken hazard link
    Given a scenario whose ICA references hazard H-99 which does not exist in the loss analysis
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then a traceability error is returned for the broken hazard link

  # SP3-VAL-14
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-14 traceability validation fails on broken constraint link
    Given a scenario whose ICA references constraint SC-99 which does not exist
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then a traceability error is returned for the broken constraint link

  # SP3-VAL-15
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-15 traceability validation fails on broken responsibility link
    Given a scenario with target_controller RESP-99 which does not exist in the control structure
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then a traceability error is returned for the broken responsibility link

  # SP3-VAL-16
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-16 traceability validation fails on broken ICA-to-scenario link
    Given an enriched threat set with ICA RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED:1
    And a scenario referencing ica_id RESP-1:CA-1-1:NOT_PROVIDED:99 which does not exist
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then a traceability error is returned for the broken ICA link

  # SP3-VAL-17
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-17 traceability validation checks provenance root is legal
    Given a scenario with provenance root risk_card
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then the provenance root is accepted

  # SP3-VAL-18
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-18 traceability validation rejects illegal provenance root
    Given a scenario with provenance root unknown_source
    When end-to-end traceability validation is performed
    Then a traceability error is returned for the illegal provenance root

  # SP3-VAL-19
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-19 orphan detection finds control structure elements not referenced by any ICA
    Given a control structure with PM-1-2 not referenced by any ICA
    When orphan detection is performed
    Then PM-1-2 is listed as an orphan element

  # SP3-VAL-20
  Scenario: SP3-VAL-20 orphan detection finds ICAs not concretized into scenarios
