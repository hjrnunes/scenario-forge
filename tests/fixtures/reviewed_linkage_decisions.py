"""Reviewed semantic decision table for non-obvious canonical linkage.

Each entry records the reviewed observation kind, binding slot, and
concise independent rationale for a linkage decision that is not
self-evident from the postcondition description alone.  Tests validate
that the canonical YAML matches these decisions.

Decisions are grouped by rationale category:
- INGRESS_DELIVERY: request/prompt delivered to agent → model_context/ingress
- TOOL_OUTCOME: tool performs or exposes the outcome → tool_invocation/tool
- STATE_PERSIST: actual persisted state in an integration → persistent_state/integration
- RENDERED_OUTPUT: outcome visible in agent rendered response → rendered_output/output_surface
- ENDPOINT_RECEIPT: data delivery/receipt at external endpoint → endpoint_receipt/integration
- AGENT_STATE: agent-internal assembled state → agent_state/agent_internal
- SOURCE_INFLUENCE: typed upstream source crosses a directed boundary into ingress

Rationale cites the postcondition description, produced reference,
and causal mechanism — not action kind/name, slot cardinality, or
taxonomy mapping.
