"""T7 final-lineage wave tests (bead scenario-forge-422o.2.7).

The final catalog-lineage outcome for the five historical base T7 records
(AP-T7-01..05) is removal from the live catalog: one defer (AP-T7-01) and
four retire (AP-T7-02..05), with an EMPTY authoritative resulting-ID set.
No T7 source has a defensible exact ATLAS operational identity; ATLAS is the
sole v1 authority, LAAF is absent, and SSSOM skos:relatedMatch rows are
non-authoritative provenance that can never qualify a record.

These tests pin that outcome:

- ``attack-patterns.yaml`` stays loader-valid with zero live records (the
  production glob merge tolerates the empty member file);
- the merged production catalog carries no AP-T7-* IDs and no
  ``threat_id == "T7"`` records;
- historical lineage for all five sources is preserved solely in
  ``catalog-lineage.yaml`` with final dispositions, empty resulting patterns,
  and stated deficiency/re-entry conditions;
- no lineage source in any file produces a resulting record that reuses one
  of the five T7 IDs (the resulting-ID set for T7 stays empty).
