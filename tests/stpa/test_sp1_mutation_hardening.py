"""Mutation hardening tests for surviving mutants in capability_profile.py.

These tests kill mutants that survived the initial mutation run because
the STPA test suite did not directly exercise ``classify_entry_point``
or the ``EntryPoint`` frozen model config.

Mutants killed:
- classify_entry_point: controllability is not None -> is None
- classify_entry_point: direction == "output" -> != "output"
- classify_entry_point: direction == "bidirectional" -> != "bidirectional"
- classify_entry_point: indirect keyword `in` -> `not in`
- classify_entry_point: system keyword `in` -> `not in`
- EntryPoint: model_config frozen=True -> False
