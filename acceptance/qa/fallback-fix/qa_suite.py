"""End-to-end QA suite for the Stage 2 fallback regression fix (scenario-forge-32aa).

This QA suite verifies the fix for the P1 regression where
``_assemble_with_fallback`` silently dropped all control actions and
feedback channels on the degraded (fallback) path because it passed
``responsibility_set.responsibilities`` (Call 2a output — no CAs/FBs)
to ``_sanitize_for_fallback`` and ``_strip_all_element_refs`` without
first assigning the CAs/FBs from the ``ControlElementSet`` (Call 2b
output) onto the responsibilities.

The fix: ``_assemble_with_fallback`` must call
``_assign_elements_to_responsibilities`` to attach CAs/FBs from the
``ControlElementSet`` onto the responsibilities BEFORE the sanitize
tier, so both the sanitize and strip tiers operate on the full
structure and preserve valid references while nullifying invalid ones.

Two execution modes:

1. **Static checks** (no LLM needed): inspect the source code of
   ``control_structure.py`` via AST analysis and run the acceptance
   feature through the acceptance runtime.  These verify the structural
   fix without requiring an LLM endpoint.

2. **Dynamic checks** (no LLM needed): invoke
   ``_assemble_with_fallback`` directly through the acceptance runtime
   with crafted inputs that trigger both the sanitize and strip tiers,
   and verify CAs/FBs are carried over with valid refs preserved and
   invalid refs nullified.

Usage::

    # Static checks only (fast, no LLM)
    uv run python acceptance/qa/fallback-fix/qa_suite.py --static

    # Dynamic checks (no LLM, uses acceptance runtime)
    uv run python acceptance/qa/fallback-fix/qa_suite.py --dynamic

    # All checks
    uv run python acceptance/qa/fallback-fix/qa_suite.py --all

Exit codes:
    0 — all checks passed
    1 — one or more checks failed
