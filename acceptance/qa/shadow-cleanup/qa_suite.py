"""End-to-end QA suite for the shadowed registration cleanup (bead jrds).

Covers the removal of 39 dead step-pattern registrations from
``acceptance/acceptance_runtime.py`` and the unmarking of two xfail'd
property tests in ``tests/stpa/test_acceptance_harness_property.py``.

Problem
-------
``STEP_PATTERNS`` is an ordered list; lookup takes the first match.
When the same pattern is registered in the same scope with two
different handlers, only one is live and the rest is dead code.  The
cleanup removes the 39 dead registrations identified in the inventory.

Two classes of work
-------------------
- **Class A (27 mechanical removals)**: the dead handler is no larger
  than the live one.  Deleting the dead registration cannot change
  behaviour.
- **Class B (12 judgement calls)**: the live handler is materially
  smaller than the dead one it shadows.  Each case has an explicit
  keep-or-promote decision recorded in this suite.

Execution modes
---------------
``--static``
    AST and source-text assertions over ``acceptance_runtime.py`` and
    the property-test file.  No imports of the runtime.

``--dynamic``
    Imports ``acceptance_runtime``, inspects ``STEP_PATTERNS``, runs
    ``find_pattern_conflicts`` against IR and synthetic step texts,
    verifies live-handler assignments for all 12 Class B patterns, and
    runs the two property tests with pytest.

``--pipeline``
    Checks that can only be answered by a real model call against a
    live endpoint.  These SKIP without
    ``SCENARIO_FORGE_QA_PIPELINE=1`` and ``--run-dir``.

Usage::

    uv run python acceptance/qa/shadow-cleanup/qa_suite.py --static
    uv run python acceptance/qa/shadow-cleanup/qa_suite.py --dynamic
    uv run python acceptance/qa/shadow-cleanup/qa_suite.py --all

Exit codes:
    0 — all executed checks passed (skipped pipeline checks do not fail)
    1 — one or more executed checks failed
