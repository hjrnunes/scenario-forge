## ATLAS Case Studies Not Yet Referenced

The current 10 attack patterns reference these case studies:
- **Referenced (8)**: CS0040, CS0041, CS0048, CS0049, CS0051, CS0052, CS0053, CS0055
  - NOTE: CS0059 and CS0062 were previously listed here but DO NOT EXIST in ATLAS-2026.05.yaml (valid range: CS0000-CS0056)

ATLAS-2026.05.yaml contains **57 total case studies** (CS0000-CS0056). The agentic case studies (CS0040-CS0056, 17 total) are the most relevant.

### Agentic Case Studies Not Yet Referenced (9 of 17)

> **WARNING**: Earlier versions of this document listed CS0057-CS0062 as real case studies. These DO NOT EXIST in ATLAS-2026.05.yaml. The valid range is CS0000-CS0056 only. Lines below referencing CS0057+ have been removed.

| Case Study | Name | Type | Target | Agentic | Tactic Sequence Available | Priority |
|------------|------|------|--------|---------|---------------------------|----------|
| AML.CS0042 | SesameOp: AI API for C2 | Incident | OpenAI Assistants API | Yes | Minimal (1-step; C2 only) | P2 |
| AML.CS0043 | Malware with embedded prompt injection | Incident | LLM malware detectors | Yes | Yes (8 steps) | P3 |
| AML.CS0044 | LAMEHUG: AI-generated polymorphic commands | Incident | APT28 malware | Yes | Yes (8 steps) | P3 |
| AML.CS0045 | MCP data exfiltration (Cursor) | Exercise | Cursor | Yes | **Yes (11 steps, 7 tactics)** | **P1** |
| AML.CS0046 | Claude Computer Use data destruction | Exercise | Claude Computer Use | Yes | **Yes (7 steps)** | **P1** |
| AML.CS0047 | Amazon Q destructive agent deployment | Incident | Amazon Q VS Code | Yes | **Yes (7 steps)** | **P1** |
| AML.CS0050 | OpenClaw 1-click RCE | Exercise | OpenClaw | Yes | **Yes (9 steps)** | **P1** |
| AML.CS0054 | MCP tool docstring injection | Exercise | MCP | Yes | **Yes (9 steps)** | **P1** |
| AML.CS0056 | Model distillation campaigns | Incident | Anthropic Claude | No | Yes (6 steps) | P3 (out of scope) |

**Key observations:**
- **P1 (5 cases)**: Direct agentic exploitation with full tactic sequences — CS0045, CS0046, CS0047, CS0050, CS0054
- **P2 (1 case)**: AI-as-infrastructure patterns — CS0042
- **P3 (1 case)**: Out of scope (model theft) — CS0056
- **P3 (2 cases)**: AI-augmented malware (target is not an agent) — CS0043, CS0044

### Non-Agentic Case Studies (CS0000-CS0039, 40 total)

These focus on traditional ML, early LLM attacks, and pre-agentic systems. **Low priority** for pattern extraction because:
- Target traditional ML models (image classifiers, malware detectors, recommender systems)
- Predate agentic AI capabilities (tool use, memory, computer use, multi-agent)
- Most attacks are model evasion, poisoning, or extraction — not agent misuse

**Notable exceptions:**
- **CS0024** (Morris II Worm): RAG-based email assistant worm — already studied in staging analysis
- **CS0026** (M365 Copilot transaction hijacking): RAG poisoning + tool misuse — likely covered by existing AP-T1-* and AP-T2-* patterns
- **CS0035** (Slack AI data exfiltration): Agent memory + tool abuse — likely covered
- **CS0037** (Copilot Studio data exfiltration): Agent tool chain exploitation — likely covered

**Recommendation**: Review CS0024, CS0026, CS0035, CS0037 for kill chain enrichment opportunities on existing patterns, but prioritize CS0040-CS0062 for new pattern extraction.

## Source Quality Assessment

### Source 1: MITRE ATLAS Case Studies CS0040-CS0056

**Procedural depth**: **Explicit steps** — every case study has a numbered, ordered kill chain with `leads-to` pointers

**Estimated pattern yield**: Revised down from earlier estimate — original "13 new patterns + 5 enrichments" count included hallucinated CS0057-CS0062

**Tactic sequence quality**: **High** — 5-18 steps per case study, spans 4-8 distinct ATLAS tactics, explicit tactic assignment per step

**Notes**:
- 17 agentic case studies total (CS0040-CS0056)
- 8 already referenced in existing patterns
- 9 unreferenced, of which 5 are P1 priority
- Each case study includes: actor, target, date, type (Incident/Exercise), references, step descriptions, technique mappings, leads-to relationships
- Format: ATLAS v6 YAML with `relationships.employs` section encoding the kill chain
- **Actionable**: Ready for extraction; staging analysis provides complete transformation methodology

---

### Source 2: Microsoft Copilot Security Research

**Procedural depth**: **Implicit steps** — research papers describe attack mechanisms but not always in step-by-step format

**Estimated pattern yield**: 2-4 patterns (RAG poisoning, agent memory exploitation, connected app attacks)

**Tactic sequence quality**: **Medium** — procedural details exist but need extraction and abstraction

**Notes**:
- Sources: Microsoft Security blog posts, M365 Copilot security research, Azure OpenAI security advisories
- NOTE: CS0059 ("EchoLeak") was previously referenced here but does not exist in ATLAS
- Example: M365 Copilot transaction hijacking (CS0026) — RAG + tool misuse
- **Status**: Many covered by ATLAS case studies; review for kill chain enrichment opportunities

---

### Source 3: AI Safety Institute (ASI) Taxonomy

**Procedural depth**: **Description only** — high-level threat descriptions, no procedural steps

**Estimated pattern yield**: 0 new patterns (already mapped via cross-taxonomy-mappings.yaml)

**Tactic sequence quality**: **None** — ASI provides threat categories (ASI01-ASI10), not attack procedures

**Notes**:
- ASI01: Goal Hijacking, ASI02: Tool Misuse, ASI03: Identity/Privilege Abuse, ASI04: Compromise Supply Chain, ASI05: Unexpected Code Attacks, ASI06: Persistent Agent Compromise, ASI07: Insecure Inter-Agent Protocols, ASI08: Audit Trail Evasion, ASI09: Human Manipulation, ASI10: Scaling Violations
- All scenario-forge patterns already map to ASI IDs via `t_to_asi` in cross-taxonomy-mappings.yaml
- **Value**: Validation that scenario-forge threat coverage aligns with industry taxonomy, not a pattern source

---

### Source 4: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) AI Security Framework

**Procedural depth**: **Description only** — control objectives and risk areas, not attack procedures

**Estimated pattern yield**: 0 new patterns

**Tactic sequence quality**: **None** — CSA provides defense recommendations, not adversary TTPs

**Notes**:
- CSA framework focuses on secure AI development lifecycle, governance, and control frameworks
- Does not describe specific attack mechanisms or kill chains
- **Value**: Could inform mitigation mappings, not useful for attack pattern extraction

---

### Source 5: LAAF (OWASP Language Model Abuse Framework)

**Procedural depth**: **Implicit steps** — technique descriptions include some procedural detail

**Estimated pattern yield**: 0 new patterns (already mapped via SSSOM)

**Tactic sequence quality**: **Low** — LAAF techniques describe injection/delivery methods but not complete kill chains

**Notes**:
- LAAF provides 20+ LLM abuse techniques (S1-S20+, M1-M20+, etc.)
- All scenario-forge patterns already map to LAAF technique IDs via SSSOM provenance files
- Example: S1 (Direct Prompt Injection), S2 (Indirect Prompt Injection), M3 (Multi-Turn Manipulation)
- **Value**: Already integrated; no new patterns to extract

---

### Source 6: NIST AI 100-2e2023

**Procedural depth**: **Description only** — attack taxonomy and lifecycle model, not procedural TTPs

**Estimated pattern yield**: 0 new patterns (already used for classification)

**Tactic sequence quality**: **None** — NIST provides abstract attack classes, not kill chains

**Notes**:
- NIST taxonomy used for `nist_classification.attack_class` field in scenario-forge patterns
- Example: `genai.indirect_prompt_injection.abuse_violations`, `poisoning.targeted_poisoning`
- Provides attacker_goal/knowledge/learning_stage classification scheme
- **Value**: Already integrated via pattern metadata; not a procedural attack source

---

### Source 7: OWASP GenAI Top 10

**Procedural depth**: **Description only** — threat categories with example scenarios, not step-by-step procedures

**Estimated pattern yield**: 0 new patterns (conceptually covered by existing T1-T17)

**Tactic sequence quality**: **Low** — GenAI Top 10 describes threat types but not operational kill chains

**Notes**:
- LLM01: Prompt Injection, LLM02: Insecure Output Handling, LLM03: Training Data Poisoning, LLM04: Model Denial of Service, LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities, LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure, LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design, LLM08: Excessive Agency, LLM09: Overreliance, LLM10: Model Theft
- Scenario-forge's T1-T17 taxonomy already subsumes these concepts
- **Value**: Validation of threat coverage; no new procedural content

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Extract from ATLAS CS0040-CS0056 (agentic case studies)

**Why**: Complete kill chains, explicit tactic sequences, agentic focus, already analyzed in staging

**Which case studies**:
1. **CS0045** (MCP data exfiltration via Cursor) → AP-T2-07
2. **CS0046** (Claude Computer Use data destruction) → AP-T2-08
3. **CS0047** (Amazon Q destructive agent deployment) → already used for AP-T11-02
4. **CS0050** (OpenClaw 1-click RCE) → AP-T3-05
5. **CS0054** (MCP tool docstring injection) → AP-T16-04

**Method**: Follow case-study-abstraction-strategy.md transformation rules:
- Strip domain-specific anchors (named actors, specific targets, CVEs)
- Keep tactical progression and technique IDs
- Abstract action descriptions to be domain-agnostic
- Add scenario-forge prerequisite_capabilities and NIST classification
- Create SSSOM provenance entries mapping to ATLAS technique IDs

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks for 6 P1 patterns + SSSOM + validation)

---

### Priority 2: Review CS0042 for AI-as-Infrastructure Patterns

**Why**: Represents a genuinely new category (AI service as C2 relay) not currently modeled

**Caveat**: This is an attack USING AI services, not an attack ON AI agents. The AI is infrastructure, not target. May warrant a separate threat category (proposed T18) or annotation on existing T11 patterns. CS0061, previously listed alongside CS0042, does not exist.

**Method**: Determine if this fits the scenario-forge threat model (agentic system threats) or if it is out of scope (traditional malware using AI APIs)

**Effort**: Low (1 week for analysis + 1 pattern if in scope)

---

### Priority 3: Enrich Existing Patterns with Kill Chains from ATLAS

**Why**: Many existing patterns were derived from ATLAS case studies but lack explicit kill chain scaffolds

**Which patterns**:
- AP-T1-01 ← CS0040 (ChatGPT memory poisoning)
- AP-T17-01/AP-T17-02 ← CS0041, CS0049 (rules file backdoor, skill supply chain)
- AP-T11-01 ← CS0052 (prompt-to-RCE frameworks); AP-T11-02 now mapped to CS0047 (CS0062 does not exist)

**Method**: Add `kill_chain` section to existing patterns using format-comparison-and-synthesis.md Option B (hybrid model)

**Effort**: Low-medium (1-2 weeks for 5 patterns)

---

### Priority 4: Cross-Check Non-Agentic Case Studies for Enrichment

**Why**: CS0024, CS0026, CS0035, CS0037 may provide kill chain details for existing memory/tool patterns

**Method**: Review case studies for tactic sequences that enrich AP-T1-*, AP-T2-* patterns

**Effort**: Low (1 week for review + documentation updates)

---

## Methodology Gaps

Based on the staging analysis, the following gaps exist in the current extraction workflow:

### Gap 1: No Automated ATLAS-to-Scenario-Forge Transformer

**Issue**: case-study-abstraction-strategy.md provides manual transformation rules, but there is no tooling to automate the extraction

**Recommendation**: Build a script that:
1. Parses ATLAS v6 YAML `relationships.employs` section
2. Extracts kill chain steps with tactic/technique/description
3. Generates scenario-forge `kill_chain` scaffold
4. Prompts for manual abstraction (strip domain details, add prerequisite_capabilities)
5. Outputs YAML pattern stub + SSSOM entries

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks for tooling development

---

### Gap 2: Kill Chain Scaffold Format Not Finalized

**Issue**: format-comparison-and-synthesis.md proposes Option B (hybrid model with kill chain templates), but the schema is not implemented in the codebase

**Recommendation**: Finalize kill chain schema before extracting new patterns:
- Define `KillChainStep` data model (step name, tactic, techniques[], abstract_action)
- Update pattern loader to parse optional `kill_chain` section
- Update templates to consume kill chain scaffolds (if present)

**Effort**: 1 week for schema design + 1 week for pipeline integration

---

### Gap 3: SSSOM Provenance Generation Is Manual

**Issue**: Each new pattern needs manual SSSOM entries mapping to ATLAS/LAAF technique IDs

**Recommendation**: Generate SSSOM entries from kill chain technique IDs automatically:
- Extract unique ATLAS technique IDs from `kill_chain[].techniques`
- Generate SSSOM rows with `skos:relatedMatch` predicate
- Include confidence=1.0, mapping_justification=ManualMappingCuration

**Effort**: 1-2 days for script

---

### Gap 4: No Validation of Kill Chain Consistency

**Issue**: If kill chains are added to patterns, the pipeline needs to validate that:
- Tactic ordering follows ATLAS matrix sequence
- Technique IDs are valid ATLAS techniques
- At least one technique from the kill chain appears in generated attack trees

**Recommendation**: Add kill chain validation checks to `validation.py`:
- `check_kill_chain_tactic_ordering()` — warn if tactics are out of ATLAS sequence
- `check_kill_chain_technique_validity()` — verify all technique IDs exist in ATLAS
- Extend `check_leaf_technique_provenance()` to check kill chain techniques

**Effort**: 1 week for validation logic

---

## Appendix: ATLAS Tactic Reference

For kill chain extraction, ATLAS tactics (ordered by matrix position):

| Position | ID | Name |
|----------|-----|------|
| 1 | AML.TA0002 | Reconnaissance |
| 2 | AML.TA0003 | Resource Development |
| 3 | AML.TA0004 | Initial Access |
| 4 | AML.TA0000 | AI Model Access |
| 5 | AML.TA0005 | Execution |
| 6 | AML.TA0006 | Persistence |
| 7 | AML.TA0012 | Privilege Escalation |
| 8 | AML.TA0007 | Defense Evasion |
| 9 | AML.TA0013 | Credential Access |
| 10 | AML.TA0008 | Discovery |
| 11 | AML.TA0015 | Lateral Movement |
| 12 | AML.TA0009 | Collection |
| 13 | AML.TA0001 | AI Attack Staging |
| 14 | AML.TA0014 | Command and Control |
| 15 | AML.TA0010 | Exfiltration |
| 16 | AML.TA0011 | Impact |

**Notes**:
- AML.TA0000 (AI Model Access) and AML.TA0001 (AI Attack Staging) are AI-specific tactics with no ATT&CK equivalent
- Most agentic kill chains span 4-8 tactics (typically: Resource Development → Initial Access → Execution → Persistence/Evasion → Collection/Exfiltration → Impact)
