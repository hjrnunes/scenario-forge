"""Zone enforcement logic for narratives and attack trees.

Action-aware enforcement (cmps.9):
- External preconditions (zone=None) are never repaired into active AI zones.
- Internal action zone requirements remain profile-active.
- Tool invocation zone must be exactly 'tool_execution'.
- Invalid zones are rejected (violation list), not silently pruned (cmps.9 review correction 4).
