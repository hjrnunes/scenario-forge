"""Standalone projection traceability validation for ScenarioEnvelope.

Validates that every generated artifact (narrative, attack tree, behavior
spec) is completely and faithfully traced to the deeply immutable canonical
projection persisted on the envelope (bead ``scenario-forge-422o.4``).

This module defines the **violations and validation**, not the final
retry/quarantine state machine (deferred to cmps.5).  It exposes typed
validation inputs and results that cmps.5 will consume.

Checks performed:

1. **Projection integrity** — the embedded :class:`ProjectionSnapshot` is
   self-validating (digest-verified).  When authoritative source inputs
   are supplied, the projection and execution requirements are recomputed
   and compared to detect drift or nested mutation.

2. **Coverage** — every selected projected step is covered by narrative
   actions, attack-tree leaves, and behavior actions.

3. **Order preservation** — realization mappings preserve the total order
   of projected steps within each artifact stage.

4. **No unprojected steps** — no realization mapping or generated action
   claims a step ID absent from the projection.

5. **Resource binding correctness** — generated actions referencing
   canonical resources match the projection's resource bindings.

6. **Ingress identity** — the canonical initial ingress ID is consistent
   across the projection, envelope, actor, narrative, and attack tree.

7. **OR-tree prohibition** — authoritative scenario trees prohibit OR
   nodes in v1; AND decomposition represents one concrete execution only.

8. **Assertion mapping** — behavior assertions map to projected observable
   postconditions, not to setup steps.

9. **Forged opaque IDs** — generated content must not reference opaque IDs
   absent from the projection.
