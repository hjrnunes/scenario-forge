"""Deterministic reviewed attack-complexity rule table (cmps.7).

One closed, versioned rule table with two phases:

- **Candidate lower bound** (:func:`assess_candidate_complexity`) — runs
  before Call 0 and consumes only typed candidate-v2 inputs:
  :class:`~scenario_forge.pipeline.projection.ProjectedCandidate`
  ``complexity_inputs``, the immutable projection's selected steps, and
  the derived adapter-neutral execution requirements.
- **Final assessment** (:func:`assess_final_complexity`) — runs after
  typed realized actions exist and *adds only* structured typed
  action/access evidence: the discriminated attack-tree leaf actions
  (cmps.9) and the typed actor access provenance (cmps.6).

Technique tuples, generated prose, free-text keyword matching, labels,
and zone counts are never inputs.  Concepts without a typed,
unambiguous representation are documented as unsupported/deferred in
``scenario_forge.models.complexity`` — no heuristic is invented for
them.  Candidate-v2 fails closed where explicit step/resource linkage
is missing; this policy does not infer those semantics either.

Admission invariant (:func:`evaluate_capability_admission`): actor
capability >= attack required level.  The check is fail-closed and
returns typed routing data for the earliest responsible stage,
determined per triggering rule by the authoritative rule table
(``COMPLEXITY_RULE_TABLE``): Call 0 bounded actor regeneration for
evidence known at actor generation (projection inputs, access
provenance), attack-tree/realization retry for evidence introduced by
typed realized actions after Call 0, and quarantine only as the
fail-closed fallback owned by cmps.5.  Wiring those mechanisms is
deferred to cmps.5 (lifecycle ownership); cmps.7 exposes only the
contract.
