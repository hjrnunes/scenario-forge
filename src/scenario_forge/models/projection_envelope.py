"""Projection persistence and artifact traceability models for ScenarioEnvelope.

This module defines the deeply immutable, standalone canonical projection
block persisted on :class:`ScenarioEnvelope` (bead ``scenario-forge-422o.4``).

The projection block embeds the full :class:`ProjectionSnapshot` —
catalog/chain/taxonomy/mapping pins and digests, ordered selected typed
steps, condition evaluations/omissions, and concrete canonical resource
bindings — plus the derived execution requirements, projected taxonomy
mappings, canonical ingress identity, and **artifact realization
mappings** that trace every generated narrative/tree/behavior element
back to projected steps and observable postconditions.

Design invariants:

- **Deeply immutable**: the block uses ``frozen=True``/``extra="forbid"``.
  The embedded :class:`ProjectionSnapshot` is already content-addressed
  (digest-verified).  Nested mutation is detected by digest mismatch.
- **Standalone**: the block is self-contained — no taxonomy checkout is
  required to validate it.  When authoritative source inputs (the
  original :class:`AttackPattern` and :class:`CapabilityFactSnapshot`)
  are available, the projection and execution requirements can be
  recomputed and compared to detect drift.
- **Adapter-neutral**: the block carries execution requirements, not
  adapter payloads.  Generated content realizes but never selects,
  alters, omits, reorders, or fabricates projection semantics.
