"""Closed, versioned attack-complexity assessment models (cmps.7).

This module separates two concepts that legacy generation conflated:

- **Actor capability** (``ActorProfile.capability_level``) — an immutable
  attribute of the generated threat actor, fixed at Call 0 and never
  relabelled afterwards to save a generated attack.
- **Attack complexity** — a deterministic, versioned assessment of the
  capability level an attack path *requires*, derived only from typed
  candidate-v2 projection inputs and typed realized action/access
  evidence.

The assessment is persisted separately from the actor profile so reports
and metrics can show actor capability and attack complexity distinctly.

Deliberately unsupported in rule version ``1`` (no typed, unambiguous
representation exists; do not invent heuristics for these):

- privileged access prerequisites at the *candidate* phase (chain
  preconditions are generic fact ASTs without a closed fact registry);
- supply-chain/training targeting at the *candidate* phase (typed only
  via realized ``ActorAccessProvenance.access_class``);
- custom exploit/code requirements (no typed field exists in the
  candidate-v2 or realized-action models);
- the ``expert`` required level (reserved for future typed evidence).

Zone counts, technique tuples, generated prose, free-text keyword
matching, and labels are never authoritative inputs.
